# Tools for PDFs

*Here is an accumulation of other people's notes on dealing with PDFs.*

## Guide (with links to tools) on dealing with PDFs

An excellent overview / workshop with lots of links and instructions:
> Resources and worksheet for the NICAR 2016 workshop
> https://github.com/jsfenfen/parsing-prickly-pdfs

## Misc ideas


### If it has tables:

> * [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/)
> * [PDF Plumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber): Really easy to use
> * [CometDocs](www.cometdocs.com/) (need to purchase)

### If it has plain text:
> * [DocumentCloud](http://www.documentcloud.org/): Enables you to search text in your documents
> * [SmallPDF](https://smallpdf.com/)
> * [Zamzar](http://www.zamzar.com/convert/pdf-to-txt/) website

### Other

> If you have many files and you intend to download all the text afterwards, [Overview](https://overviewdocs.com/) will let you get a CSV out with one row per document, without writing any code, using the export button.

> [Captricity](http://captricity.com/) say they’re built to get forms-based data just like this. If you end up trying them please report back!

> I've successfully used [Datawatch Monarch](www.datawatch.com/our-platform/monarch/) for years to handle files like this.. It allows you, via a gui, to design an extraction template based on the relative location of fields, or based on the labels. The documentation is excellent and if you spend a half-day doing the tutorials that come with it, you can learn it pretty quickly.

> The problem is the software has gone from being expensive to VERY expensive....

> [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter13/) has a pretty good chapter on using Python to work with PDF documents. Here are some more options.

> There are programs to extract text and even structure from a PDF...[Tabula](http://tabula.technology/) and [ABBYY](https://www.abbyy.com/), for example.

> Doesn't [Cogniview](https://www.cogniview.com/), which you were the first to recommend, do something similar in that you select what you want to use from a recurring pattern and flattens it into a table?

> The other approach I’m in the process of attempting is converting to HTML so I can use [import.io](https://www.import.io/) to parse that.

> Third option on the approach you’re trying: check http://www.scrapinghub.com. Free and in my experience, far better than import.io in the GUI to control what you get on the scrape.
